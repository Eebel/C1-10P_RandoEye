# C1-10P_RandoEye

This project will run an Arduino Nano.  It requires the NeoPatterns library to be added to your project.  It also requires the Adafruit Neopixels library.
It runs three independent and simultaneous patterns:  the main eyes, the periscop, and th eladder lights.
This sketch is using the NeoPatterns library.  It uses three NeoPatterns objects to have the the main eyes, the ladder, and the periscope run 
independently and simultaneously without having to worry about counting or keeping track the milliseconds in the main loop. 
This library would be suitable for those folks programming their own patterns on the R2-D2 DataPanel as well.
